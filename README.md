# InstAssistant 
### Python code which will help you grow your Instagram account.

<br/>


## Current Features

- [Like](https://github.com/BerzanTas/InstAssistant/blob/master/likeloop.py "Source code for this feature") the most recent posts of the given hashtag.
- [Follow](https://github.com/BerzanTas/InstAssistant/blob/master/follows.py "Source code for this feature") a given users followers.
- [Unfollow](https://github.com/BerzanTas/InstAssistant/blob/master/unfollow.py "Source code for this feature") users you are following.

<br/>

## Quick Grow Tips

First of all post a couple of images or reels on your niche account, so people who clicks on your instagram will be more in to following you.
Next, use [Follow](https://github.com/BerzanTas/InstAssistant/blob/master/follows.py "Source code for this feature") feature, to get people's attention. Remember,
the account whose followers you are going to follow must be similar one to yours! After following about 300 people (not in a single day) you can start liking posts of a hashtag describing your account (like #makeup for an niche account about make-up) using the [Like](https://github.com/BerzanTas/InstAssistant/blob/master/likeloop.py "Source code for this feature") feature. Lastly, after couple of days, start unfollowing people with [Unfollow](https://github.com/BerzanTas/InstAssistant/blob/master/unfollow.py "Source code for this feature") feature. </br> And repeat this process.
